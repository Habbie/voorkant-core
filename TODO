- screen brightness management
- figure out usage with nabu casa remote access
- config? store as HA state, identified by some per-client ID?
- figure out crash when an entity has too many buttons (is this the reason? climate crashes on a big terminal too)
- when a thread segfaults, exit everything, don't go into a tight loop
- valgrind is unhappy even before the crash, clean this up

- entity list scrolls back to top when i focus buttons

- finally got a state-related crash. With voorkant focused on the "new devices discovered" thing, dismissing that notification in HA crashes voorkant.
