- FTXUI first
- LVGL second
- then see if we can port to ESP
- improv wifi/serial for config, including HA URL?
- somebody on #homeassistant suggested that a web frontend -without- JS would be useful in some situations
  - once we have LVGL, perhaps we can even emit useful PNGs via HTTP?

- oauth setup flow instead of somehow getting an API key and URL?

- current storage is a few maps, turned into sorted-by-name integer indexes for FTXUI
  - maybe boost multi index can simplify our life here?
  - perhaps different UI frontends have very different needs (depending on, say, how much state they store internally) - so perhaps the UI frontend should get to decide the storage model? we could have a few base classes that make sense for different frontends

- instead of building on debian 7 or something like I did for the LVGL demo, build on https://github.com/pypa/manylinux ?
